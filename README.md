# Optimized-ETL-Pipeline-and-Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Uber-Dataset-Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of Uber trip data to uncover critical insights into trip distances, fare distributions, vendor performance, and revenue trends. By leveraging an **ETL pipeline** developed in Python, the project processes large datasets, transforms raw data into actionable information, and loads it into a SQL Server data warehouse. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **total tips per vendor** and **revenue by trip distance** are visualized through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  

### Key Objectives:  
- **Efficient Data Processing:** Build an ETL pipeline to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- **Data Analysis:** Perform in-depth analysis using SQL queries to identify patterns and trends.  
- **Visualization:** Create an intuitive Power BI dashboard to present key metrics and insights visually.  
- **Scalability:** Design a system that handles large Uber datasets with ease and delivers rapid, actionable insights.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** For data cleaning, transformation, and automation of the ETL pipeline.  
- **SQL Server:** To store and manage processed data, serving as the backend data warehouse.  
- **SQL:** For querying, filtering, and analyzing data within SQL Server.  
- **Power BI:** To create visual dashboards that highlight vendor performance, fare distribution, and overall trip metrics.  
- **Bulk Insert (SQL Server):** For efficient loading of large CSV datasets into SQL Server tables.

## Features and Highlights  
- **Automated ETL Pipeline:**  
  - Extracts raw Uber data from CSV files.  
  - Cleans and transforms the data using Python (Pandas).  
  - Loads the processed data into SQL Server.  
- **SQL-Driven Analysis:**  
  - Custom SQL queries to analyze key metrics such as trip frequency, revenue, vendor performance, and payment distributions.  
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:**  
  - Visualize key insights including:  
    - **Total Revenue by Trip Distance**  
    - **Total Tips per Vendor**  
    - **Trip Counts by Payment Type**  
    - **Fare and Distance Distribution**  
- **Data Warehousing:**  
  - Design and implement a data warehouse schema to structure trip, fare, and vendor data for optimal performance.  

---

## Data Insights and Use Cases  
- **Vendor Comparison:** Analyze how vendors perform based on total trips, tips received, and average fares.  
- **Revenue Breakdown:** Evaluate the correlation between trip distance and fare revenue.  
- **Customer Behavior:** Understand tipping patterns, preferred payment methods, and peak trip hours.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimize vendor performance and pricing strategies by identifying underperforming areas.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Extraction:**  
   - Collect raw Uber trip data in CSV format.  
2. **Transformation (ETL Process):**  
   - Clean missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Perform transformations to calculate key metrics such as revenue per trip, total tips, etc.  
3. **Loading into SQL Server:**  
   - Bulk insert the transformed data into SQL Server tables.  
4. **Data Analysis (SQL):**  
   - Query the data warehouse to analyze vendor performance, fare patterns, and trip statistics.  
5. **Visualization with Power BI:**  
   - Build custom reports and dashboards to present data-driven insights in an intuitive format.
